summary: Rice Model

description: |
  The Tier I Rice Model (Version 1.0) is designed to estimate surface water exposure from the use
  f pesticide in rice paddies. It is a screening level model that is based on the Interim Rice
  Model, which has been used by the Environmental Fate and Effects Division for multiple years.
  The model calculates a single, screening-level concentration that represents both short and
  long term surface water exposures. The screening-level concentraion can be used for both
  aquatic ecological risk assessments and drinking water exposure assessments for human health
  risk assessment.

summary: STIR Model

description: |
  The STIR model was developed as a screening model to estimate inhalation risk of chemicals to
  irds and mammals. Chemical specific physical properties are required for executing the model.
  Vapor phase and droplet-spray exposure risks are estimated in STIR and then compared to avian
  inhalation or mammalian inhalation and oral toxicity data. Inhalation exposure routes addressed
  by the model include directly applied spray, volatilization of residues on plant canopy and
  volatilization of residues in soil.

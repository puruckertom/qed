<p>All individual dissipation processes (e.g., metabolism, hydrolysis, volatilization) are represented as first-order in concentration, as described later. This representation is the same for both the current EXAMS-based model and the VVWM. For the VVWM, on any given day, the mass of a pesticide in the surface water system is described by two differential equations. Equation 4-1 represents a mass balance on the littoral zone and equation 4-2 represents a mass balance on the benthic zone.</p>

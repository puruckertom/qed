<p>The proposed VVWM is conceptually similar to the current EXAMS-based model in that both are 2-compartment models driven by first-order processes. The proposed VVWM differs from the current model in that it allows for volume changes on a daily basis, depending on runoff, precipitation, or evaporation. The proposed model also allows for temperature, wind speed and pesticide-dissipation processes to vary on a daily basis, which is more in line with the available meteorologic and hydrologic input data. In addition, it is proposed that the characteristics of the water body (depth, surface area, and associated drainage area) be scenario specific, such that the water body characteristics are consistent with the associated regional-specific PRZM field scenario.</p>
<p>The VVWM is conceptualized in Figure 4-2 and consists of two zones--a littoral zone and a benthic zone. Each individual zone is completely mixed and at equilibrium with all phases within the individual zone, with equilibrium within each zone described by a linear isotherm. The two zones are coupled by a turbulent-mixing first-order mass-transfer process. Figure 4-2 also shows that the water volume may vary due to inputs of precipitation and runoff and by outputs of evaporation and overflow.</p>

<p>For this proposed model, the mathematical conceptualization of the water body is formed using daily piecewise solutions. The water body volume is assumed to be constant over the duration of a day, but it is allowed to vary from day to day. In this way, an analytical solution can be retained for the daily concentrations. The assumption of daily variability is consistent with the input data for these models. For example, the runoff, rainfall, and evaporation input data are 24-hour totals, so water volume can never be more accurate than a daily value. Since EXAMS can only change system properties (e.g., temperature, flows) on a calendar-month basis, the proposed VVWM offers an improvement that can take advantage of the higher resolution input data.</p>

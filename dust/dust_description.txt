The purpose of this model is to provide an upper bound estimate of exposure of birds and mammals to pesticides through the dermal contact pathway alone. This model is 
intended for use in problem formulation to determine whether or not dermal contact exposure alone is a potential pathway of concern. This does not 
aggregate dermal contact exposure with other exposure routes (i.e., diet, inhalation, ingestion).

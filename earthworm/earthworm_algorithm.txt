For any particular environmental phase (e.g., water, soil, air, or biota) there is a corresponding "fugacity capacity" with units of mol/m<sup>3</sup>-Pa and is denoted by Z. The relationship between fugacity, fugacity capacity and chemical concentration (C) is defined by Equation 1.

<p>Equation 1</p>

<p>
Fugacity capacities for a given chemical are calculated for the phases of interest as part of the exposure point estimation methodology (Mackay and Paterson 1981). The following calculations of fugacity capacity for water (Z<sub>W</sub>, soil (Z<sub>S</sub>) and earthworms (Z<sub>E</sub>) (Equation 2-4) require several chemical-specific parameters and assumptions of system temperature (25 &#8451;) and steady state equilibrium. Parameter values relevant to Equations 2-4 are defined in Table 1.

<p>
Fugacity capacities for a given chemical are caculated for the phases of interest as part of the exposure point concentration estimation methodology. By definition, the ratio between Z values of different phases (compartments) equals the partitioning coefficient (for example, see Equation 5).

In this approach, it is assumed that a pesticide partitions between the soil, the (pore) water and the air contained within the soil of the treatment site. It is assumed that earthworms dwelling within the soil are exposed to a pesticide via ingestion of contaminated soil and pore-water (Belfroid et. al 1994). The concentration of a pesticide in earthworm tissues can be calculated according to Equation 6. The parameters of Equation 6 are defined in Table 1.

<p>
Equation 6 can be redefined using equations 2-4 as follows in Equation 7. Equation 7 is used to calculate the concentration of a pesticide in earthworms inhabiting the soil of treatment sites.

<p>Equation 7</p>

<p>
L can be based on the lipid content of earthworms, which was assumed to be 0.01 (Cobb et al. 1995). The resulting C<sub>E</sub> value is in units of mol/m<sup>3</sup>. This value is converted to units of g/kg using Equation 8. The density of the earthworm (&#961;<sub>E</sub>) is assumed to be 1000kg/m<sup>3</sup> (equivalent to density of water). The resulting concentration of pesticide in earthworms denotes in (C<sub>E</sub><sup>*</sup>) of Equation 8.

    <center><h2>DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES CALCULATOR AND ASSOCIATED DATABASES IN SUPPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FATE SIMULATOR</h2></center>
    <p>The ultimate goal of this project is the development of a FRAMES-based Environmental Fate Simulator (EFS).  When based on chemical structure and knowledge of the environmental system of interest (e.g., surface water versus anaerobic sediment), it will provide an estimate of the physicochemical properties of the parent chemical and its potential transformation products.  The two primary components that are being developed under the SERDP project include the 1) Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC) and Associated Databases and 2) Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS).
    <blockquote>
    <p>1.  Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC) and Associated Databases:  Based on chemical structure, the PPC will provide the physicochemical properties (Table 1) and reaction system products based on different environmental conditions (Table 2).  The RPS will provide the transformation pathways and products for reduction, and hydrolysis and specific biodegradation pathways .  The question of whether or not these transformation pathways occur will be dependent on the predicted reactions rates, which in turn will be dependent on the environmental conditions provided/chosen by the user.  An example output from the RPS follows:  RDX has been shown to undergo sequential reduction in anaerobic systems to form the N-Nitroso intermediates.

    <p>The RPS would provide the parent chemical and transformation products that would be used to populate the FRAMES Constituent Database Editor (CDBE).
    <p>2.  Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS):  Based on functional group analysis (i.e., through SMILES string analysis), the RPS will provide transformation pathways and products as a function of environmental conditions, including reductive transformation, hydrolysis, and, for specific biodegradation pathways, organic chemicals of interest.  The functional groups and transformations pathways for reductive transformation are listed in Table 3 and those for hydrolysis are listed in Table 4.  Table 5 includes the expanded list of carboxylic and carbonic acid derivatives, which are to be included in the list of hydrolysable functional groups.

    </blockquote>
    <p>The RPS will be based on the use of SMILES string notation to recognize functional groups.  The output of the RPS will include the chemical structures of all of the reaction products that can potentially result from reductive transformation and hydrolysis.  For reductive transformations, each even-electron intermediate should be illustrated in the transformation pathway .  The following examples of aromatic azo and nitroaromatic reduction serve to illustrate this point:
    <p>A chemical database editor and database module would be provided for the user to register organic chemicals of interest, capture their biodegradation pathways, and provide users with physicochemical properties of the parent compound and its degradation products, based on site-specific environmental properties and characteristics.  The ultimate intent of the database is to automate the process of populating input files of multimedia modeling components with consistent chemical properties.  With this database, the user would be able to select multiple chemicals per assessment, use the find option to search among listed chemical, and edit the database to include additional chemicals.  The program would be useful to environmental professionals, engineers, and scientists as a valuable source of constituent information and as a system for maintaining a customized environmental database.
